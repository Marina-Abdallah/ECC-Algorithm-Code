# Elliptic Curve Encryption and Decryption

## Overview

This program implements elliptic curve encryption and decryption using the Diffie-Hellman key exchange technique. The code performs operations such as point addition, scalar multiplication, and modular arithmetic over a finite field. It is designed for educational purposes to demonstrate basic elliptic curve cryptography (ECC).

## Key Concepts

- **Elliptic Curve:** An elliptic curve is defined by the equation \( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \), where `a` and `b` are constants, and the curve operates over a finite field of prime order `p`.
- **Finite Field:** The calculations are performed over a finite field with prime `p` (in this case, \( p = 59 \)).
- **Point Addition:** This operation adds two points on the elliptic curve based on specific formulas.
- **Scalar Multiplication:** Scalar multiplication involves multiplying a point by a scalar (integer) using an efficient algorithm like LSB-first binary multiplication.
- **Encryption and Decryption:** The program demonstrates basic encryption and decryption using elliptic curve-based public-key cryptography. The encryption process involves a random scalar and a base point, while decryption is done using the receiver's private key.

## Prerequisites

- **Programming Language:** C
- **Compiler:** GCC (or any other C compiler)
- **Platform:** Cross-platform (Linux, Windows, macOS)

## Setup

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the C source file.
4. Compile the code using the following command:

   ```bash
   gcc elliptic_curve.c -o elliptic_curve
   ```

5. Run the program with:

   ```bash
   ./elliptic_curve
   ```

## Explanation of the Code

### 1. **Elliptic Curve Parameters**
   - The elliptic curve is defined with the equation:  
     \( y^2 = x^3 + 4x + 20 \mod 59 \)  
   - The prime number `p = 59` is used as the modulus for all calculations, representing the finite field over which the elliptic curve is defined.

### 2. **Private and Public Keys**
   - **Private Key:** A secret key that is used to decrypt messages. In this example, `PrivKey = 6`.
   - **Public Key:** A public key that can be shared with others for encryption purposes. It is generated by multiplying the private key with a base point on the curve.

### 3. **Point Generation (`generate()` function)**
   - This function generates all points on the elliptic curve that satisfy the equation \( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p \). These points are stored in a 2D array for later use.

### 4. **Key Generation (`genKey()` function)**
   - The public key is generated by performing scalar multiplication of the base point by the private key. This operation uses elliptic curve point multiplication (`sclr_mult()`).

### 5. **Encryption Process**
   - A message point (from the generated points) is selected, and encryption is performed using a random scalar. The encrypted message is represented as a pair of points:
     - **P:** A random point derived from the base point.
     - **R:** The encrypted point, which is the result of adding the message point and a point generated from the receiver's public key.

### 6. **Decryption Process**
   - The private key of the receiver is used to perform scalar multiplication on the point `P` to compute an intermediate value. This intermediate value is then subtracted from the encrypted point `R` to recover the original message.

## Functions

### 1. `inverse(int num)`
   - Computes the modular inverse of `num` modulo `p`.

### 2. `add(int A[2], int B[2])`
   - Adds two points `A` and `B` on the elliptic curve, returning the resulting point.

### 3. `sclr_mult(int k, int P[2])`
   - Performs scalar multiplication of the point `P` by scalar `k` using the LSB-first algorithm.

### 4. `generate()`
   - Generates all the points on the elliptic curve that satisfy the curve equation \( y^2 = x^3 + ax + b \mod p \).

### 5. `genKey(int X, int P[2])`
   - Generates the public key by multiplying the private key `X` with the base point `P`.

### 6. `main()`
   - Runs the main process of key generation, encryption, and decryption.

## Example Output

```bash
Number of points found on the curve is 12
0(1,8)
1(1,51)
2(2,43)
3(2,16)
4(3,17)
5(3,42)
6(4,8)
7(4,51)
8(5,43)
9(5,16)
10(6,17)
11(6,42)
The Public Key is (14, 33)
The message point is (2, 43)
The encrypted point is [(13, 41), (35, 13)]
The message point is (2, 43)
```

## Notes

- The program is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the core concepts of elliptic curve cryptography.
- The prime number `p` and elliptic curve parameters `a` and `b` can be changed to experiment with different curves and fields.
- The encryption and decryption steps demonstrate how elliptic curve cryptography can be used for secure communications.
